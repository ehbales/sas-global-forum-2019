# Description

SAS® Studio provides an elegant programming environment that can run new and existing SAS® programs, read files from many data sources, and much more. However, when programs, files or data sets contain national characters, you can sometimes see truncated strings or odd substitutions in your character data. This demo shows you some of the common issues you might see when reading national characters into SAS Studio and teaches you how to circumvent those problems.
